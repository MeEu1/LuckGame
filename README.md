# LuckGame
Simple game in which if you press the button in the wrong time you loose

# How it works:
A random number between 0 and 10 is generated. If the number is greater than 6, the green LED is blinked, if not, the red LED blinks. 
If you press the button when the green LED is activated, you gain 1 point. If you press it when red one is activated, you lose one.
If you make more than 5 points, you win, if you make less than 0 points( that is, -1 points), you lose.
